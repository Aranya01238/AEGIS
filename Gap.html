            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> UAV triggering enforcement when entering/exiting zones.</p>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aerial drone focused, not ground rover.</li>
                <li>No payload securing system.</li>
                <li>No dual-microcontroller setup.</li>
                <li>Lacks remote-controlled stun/fence systems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent focuses on an aerial drone system that performs enforcement actions upon entering or exiting geofenced areas. In contrast to the AEGIS bot, this invention is centered on an airborne platform rather than a ground-based rover. It also lacks the AEGIS's dual-microcontroller setup, a physical payload security system, and the powerful remote-controlled defensive features like the stun module or electrified fencing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US10991188B1" class="patent-title" target="_blank">3. US10991188B1 – Vehicle-Based Home Security System</a>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Surveillance from parked vehicles.</p>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stationary security use—not autonomous navigation.</li>
                <li>No payload, geofence-based locking, or remote activation.</li>
                <li>No LoRa communication or electrified defense.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent is centered on a <b>surveillance system operating from a parked vehicle</b>. Unlike the AEGIS bot, this system's security functionality is stationary, without autonomous navigation or a payload to secure. It lacks the LoRa communication for remote control and the powerful defensive features of the AEGIS bot, such as a stun module or electrified fencing, as its focus is on passive surveillance from a fixed location.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11456882B1" class="patent-title" target="_blank">4. US11456882B1 – Autonomous Swarming Surveillance and Deterrent Robots</a>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Swarm-based perimeter security robots.</p>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Includes deterrents like lights or pepper spray—not high-voltage stun or grill fencing.</li>
                <li>No payload transport or geofencing for unlocking.</li>
                <li>Swarm logic, not dual-microcontroller architecture or LoRa telemetry.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent is centered on <b>swarm-based perimeter security robots</b>. The system utilizes multiple robots to patrol and secure an area, using deterrents like lights or pepper spray. This differs from the AEGIS bot, which is a single rover designed for payload transport and security within geofenced zones. The AEGIS bot's use of a dual-microcontroller architecture and LoRa telemetry for remote control, as well as its high-voltage stun and grill fencing, are not features of this swarm-based approach.</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11395095B2" class="patent-title" target="_blank">5. US11395095B2 – Detection and Monitoring Near Geofences</a>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent focuses on <b>detecting intrusions across digital geofences using cameras</b>. Unlike the AEGIS bot, this system is not a physical, autonomous rover and does not use a solenoid lock to secure a payload. It relies solely on cameras for intrusion detection and lacks the ultrasonic and PIR sensors used by the AEGIS bot for obstacle detection. Furthermore, it does not include a manual, remote-activated defensive system like the AEGIS bot's stun module or electrified grill fencing.</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US8531293B2" class="patent-title" target="_blank">6. US8531293B2 – Predictive Geofence Crossing</a>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Predictive breach detection before zone is entered.</p>
            <p><strong>Differences:</strong></p>

                <li>No robot or rover implementation.</li>
                <li>Purely predictive software logic; no actuators or locks.</li>
                <li>No dual-microcontroller or physical payload transport.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent is centered on a <b>predictive breach detection system</b> that identifies potential security breaches before a geofenced zone is even entered. Unlike the AEGIS Defense Bot, this system is a purely software-based solution. It does not involve a physical robot or rover, nor does it use any actuators or locks to secure a physical payload. It also lacks the dual-microcontroller architecture and physical transport functionality that are core to the AEGIS bot's design.</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US11720111B2" class="patent-title" target="_blank">7. US11720111B2 – Robot Patrol Authorization with Geofencing</a>
            <p><strong>Focus:</strong> Robotic patrol authorization and dynamic geofence.</p>

            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent focuses on <b>robotic patrol authorization and dynamic geofencing</b>, a system for coordinating the movement and security of a fleet of robots. In contrast to the AEGIS Defense Bot's design, this invention does not include a payload solenoid lock or high-voltage deterrents. The system prioritizes fleet coordination and patrol authorization over the individual payload transport and user-activated defensive control via LoRa communication that are central to the AEGIS bot.</p>

            <p><strong>About:</strong><br>This patent is focused on the <b>dynamic tracking and coordination of multiple security bots</b>. Unlike the AEGIS Defense Bot, this system is designed for multi-bot coordination and management, not for the specific task of payload transport and defense. It lacks the remote communication capabilities like LoRa or Wi-Fi for defensive control and doesn't include the hardware-level security mechanisms (lock, stun, fence) that define the AEGIS bot's functionality.</p>
