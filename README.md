AEGIS Defense Bot: Autonomous Location-Lock Security RoverAbstractThe AEGIS Defense Bot is a proof-of-concept autonomous security rover designed to transport and secure a payload between two predefined geofenced zones. The rover utilizes a dual microcontroller architecture, combining the processing power and wireless communication capabilities of the ESP32-S3 with the real-time sensor processing of the Raspberry Pi Pico. Its core functionality revolves around a GPS-based geofencing system that automatically activates a solenoid lock upon exiting a 300-meter radius source zone and deactivates it upon entering a 200-meter radius destination zone. Equipped with LoRa communication for long-range remote control, ultrasonic and PIR sensors for obstacle and intruder detection, and a high-voltage stun module for defensive response, the AEGIS bot represents a robust, low-cost solution for localized security and autonomous delivery applications.1. IntroductionModern security and logistics often require solutions that can operate autonomously in challenging or remote environments. The AEGIS Defense Bot addresses this need by providing a mobile platform capable of securing and transporting items while monitoring its surroundings. This project aims to validate the integration of multiple low-cost, open-source components into a cohesive system capable of performing complex tasks, specifically focusing on the critical function of geofenced security. By proving the viability of this system, we lay the groundwork for future applications in last-mile delivery, surveillance, and automated facility management.2. Technical Architecture and Component BreakdownThe AEGIS bot’s architecture is built around a hybrid microcontroller system, with each board optimized for specific tasks.System Block Diagram              +-------------------+

Component Roles:ESP32-S3 DevKitC-1: Serves as the high-level brain for communication, solenoid control, and stun module activation.Raspberry Pi Pico: Dedicated to low-level, real-time sensor processing for GPS, ultrasonic, and PIR data.Ublox NEO-6M GPS Module: Provides real-time location data for geofencing.LoRa SX1278 Module: Enables long-range, low-power wireless communication for remote control and telemetry.Solenoid Lock: The mechanical lock activated by the ESP32 based on geo-boundaries.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors: Used for obstacle detection.PIR Sensor: Detects movement in the bot’s vicinity.Defensive Stun Module: A high-voltage output module triggered by motion or remote command.4x 12V Gear Motors & 2x L298N Motor Drivers: The drive system for the rover's mobility.3. Geofencing Logic and CalculationsThe core of the AEGIS bot's security function is its geofencing logic, implemented using the Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation. The bot's current location (lat_textcurrent,long_textcurrent) is compared to the defined zones.Haversine Formula:a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos(\phi_1)\cos(\phi_2)\sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)$$$$c = 2\cdot \arctan2(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a})$$$$d = R\cdot cWhere phi and lambda are latitude and longitude in radians, R is the Earth's radius (approx. 6,371km), and d is the calculated distance.4. Operational WorkflowThe bot follows a clear, multi-phase workflow:Initialization: System check, GPS lock, and LoRa connection.Start Phase: Unlocked and ready within the 300m Source Area.Travel Phase: Solenoid locks when outside the 300m radius; bot navigates to destination.Arrival Phase: Solenoid unlocks upon entering the 200m Destination Area.Additional Security: Stun module can be activated by PIR sensor or remote command while locked.5. Power Management and BudgetThe system relies on a 12V 2200mAh Li-ion battery to provide a robust power source for all components.Power Budget EstimateMotors: 1.0A (average moving)Microcontrollers & Sensors: 0.4ALoRa (transmitting): 0.1ATotal Average Current: 1.5AEstimated Battery Life: 2200mAh/1500mA=1.46 hours of continuous operation.6. Virtual System RenderingA professional virtual rendering of the AEGIS Defense Bot would feature a durable, low-profile chassis with a matte black or dark grey finish. The bot would be a four-wheeled vehicle with knobby off-road tires, each independently mounted to a 12V gear motor.The GPS module antenna would be centrally mounted on the top for optimal signal reception.The LoRa antenna would be a slim, flexible whip antenna extending vertically from the chassis for long-range communication.A protective housing would enclose the main electronics bay, with a clear window to reveal the ESP32-S3 and Raspberry Pi Pico boards with their status LEDs.Multiple HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors would be strategically placed on the front, back, and sides of the bot to provide 360-degree obstacle detection.The PIR sensor would be mounted on the front of the bot, angled slightly upwards to monitor the area ahead.The solenoid lock would be an internal mechanism, with a visible actuation arm or pin securing a compartment door on the bot's body.A warning light (e.g., an LED strobe) would be visible on the top of the chassis, indicating the defensive stun module is armed.7.
